## Common Patterns

Covered in detail elsewhere:
- Data loading / polling: `docs/app/hooks/CLAUDE.md`
- URL params + searchParams for tabs/filters: `docs/app/pages/settings.md`
- Modal management: `docs/app/components/modals/CLAUDE.md`
- Command palette integration: `docs/app/keyboard-shortcuts/CLAUDE.md`

## Route Guards

Every authenticated page is wrapped in `<PrivateRoute>` from `components/RouteGuards.tsx`. Public pages (marketplace, forgot-password, magic-link) are unwrapped or wrapped in `<PublicOnlyRoute>` where appropriate. Adding a new route requires updating `ROUTE_CONFIG` in `RouteGuards.test.tsx`.
